# Regex Pattern for Matching 'John Doe' with Phone Number Variants 
# (/^John\sDoe\s(?:\(\d{3}\)\s\d{3}-\d{4}|\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4})$/m)

In many data processing tasks, extracting specific information from unstructured text is a common challenge. Regular expressions (regex) provide a powerful tool for precisely defining patterns within text data, enabling efficient extraction of desired information. The provided regex pattern is designed to identify instances of the name "John Doe" along with associated phone numbers, accounting for variations in phone number formats. By leveraging anchors, quantifiers, character classes, grouping constructs, and the OR operator, this regex pattern ensures robust matching of diverse text patterns commonly encountered in datasets.

This regex pattern begins by anchoring the search at the start and end of each line to ensure accurate detection of the target name and phone number combination. It then employs character classes to match specific types of characters, such as digits for the phone number and whitespace for separating name components. Additionally, the use of quantifiers enables precise matching of the required number of digits in the phone number, ensuring validity. Through careful construction and consideration of various text patterns, this regex pattern serves as a valuable tool for efficiently extracting "John Doe" entries along with their associated phone numbers from unstructured text data.

## Summary

 In summary, the provided regular expression pattern is tailored to identify occurrences of the name "John Doe" along with associated phone numbers in unstructured text data. It incorporates a combination of anchors, quantifiers, character classes, grouping constructs, and the OR operator to ensure accurate and robust matching of diverse text patterns commonly encountered in datasets. Anchors are used to specify the start and end of each line, ensuring precise detection of the target name and phone number combination. Character classes facilitate matching of specific types of characters, such as digits for the phone number and whitespace for separating name components. Additionally, the OR operator allows for handling alternative phone number formats, enhancing the regex pattern's versatility. By leveraging these components effectively, the regex pattern serves as a valuable tool for efficiently extracting "John Doe" entries along with their associated phone numbers from unstructured text data, thereby facilitating data processing and analysis tasks.
