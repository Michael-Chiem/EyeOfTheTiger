# Regex Pattern for Matching 'John Doe' with Phone Number Variants 
# (/^John\sDoe\s(?:\(\d{3}\)\s\d{3}-\d{4}|\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4})$/m)

In many data processing tasks, extracting specific information from unstructured text is a common challenge. Regular expressions (regex) provide a powerful tool for precisely defining patterns within text data, enabling efficient extraction of desired information. The provided regex pattern is designed to identify instances of the name "John Doe" along with associated phone numbers, accounting for variations in phone number formats. By leveraging anchors, quantifiers, character classes, grouping constructs, and the OR operator, this regex pattern ensures robust matching of diverse text patterns commonly encountered in datasets.

This regex pattern begins by anchoring the search at the start and end of each line to ensure accurate detection of the target name and phone number combination. It then employs character classes to match specific types of characters, such as digits for the phone number and whitespace for separating name components. Additionally, the use of quantifiers enables precise matching of the required number of digits in the phone number, ensuring validity. Through careful construction and consideration of various text patterns, this regex pattern serves as a valuable tool for efficiently extracting "John Doe" entries along with their associated phone numbers from unstructured text data.

## Summary

 In summary, the provided regular expression pattern is tailored to identify occurrences of the name "John Doe" along with associated phone numbers in unstructured text data. It incorporates a combination of anchors, quantifiers, character classes, grouping constructs, and the OR operator to ensure accurate and robust matching of diverse text patterns commonly encountered in datasets. Anchors are used to specify the start and end of each line, ensuring precise detection of the target name and phone number combination. Character classes facilitate matching of specific types of characters, such as digits for the phone number and whitespace for separating name components. Additionally, the OR operator allows for handling alternative phone number formats, enhancing the regex pattern's versatility. By leveraging these components effectively, the regex pattern serves as a valuable tool for efficiently extracting "John Doe" entries along with their associated phone numbers from unstructured text data, thereby facilitating data processing and analysis tasks.

## Regex Components

### Anchors
- "^: Anchor - Start of the line anchor" 
- "$: Anchor - End of the line anchor"
- /<span style="color:red;">^</span>John\sDoe\s(?:\(\d{3}\)\s\d{3}-\d{4}|\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4})<span style="color:red;">$</span>/m

Anchors in regular expressions are used to specify positions in the input string. In this regex, the caret <span style="color:red;">^</span> is an anchor that asserts the start of the line. It ensures that the pattern "John Doe" must occur at the beginning of a line. Similarly, the dollar sign <span style="color:red;">$</span> is another anchor used at the end of the regex, asserting the end of the line. It ensures that the phone number pattern must occur at the end of the line. Anchors are crucial for enforcing specific positions within the input text, providing context for where matches should occur.

### Quantifiers

### Grouping Constructs

### Bracket Expressions

### Character Classes
- John\sDoe: Character Classes - Literal characters "John" followed by whitespace \s and then "Doe".
- (/^John\sDoe\s(?:\(\d{3}\)\s\d{3}-\d{4}|\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4})$/m)

Character classes represent sets of characters that can match at a particular position in the text. In this regex, \d represents any digit (equivalent to [0-9]), and \s represents any whitespace character (space, tab, newline). These character classes allow for matching of specific types of characters, such as digits for the phone number and whitespace for separating parts of the name. Character classes provide a concise way to specify a range of characters that can match at a given position, enhancing the flexibility and accuracy of regular expressions.
