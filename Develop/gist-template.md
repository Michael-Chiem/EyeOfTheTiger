## Regex Components

### Anchors
- "^: Anchor - Start of the line anchor" 
- "$: Anchor - End of the line anchor"
- /<span style="color:red;">^</span>John\sDoe\s(?:\(\d{3}\)\s\d{3}-\d{4}|\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4})<span style="color:red;">$</span>/m
- In the context of regular expressions, the forward slash / is used as a delimiter to indicate the beginning and end of a regex pattern. It's a common convention in many programming languages, including JavaScript, Perl, and Ruby, among others.

Anchors in regular expressions are used to specify positions in the input string. In this regex, the caret <span style="color:red;">^</span> is an anchor that asserts the start of the line. It ensures that the pattern "John Doe" must occur at the beginning of a line. Similarly, the dollar sign <span style="color:red;">$</span> is another anchor used at the end of the regex, asserting the end of the line. It ensures that the phone number pattern must occur at the end of the line. Anchors are crucial for enforcing specific positions within the input text, providing context for where matches should occur.

### Quantifiers
- \d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}: Quantifiers - Matches phone numbers in the format 123-456-7890.
- (/^John\sDoe\s(?:\(\d{3}\)\s\d{3}-\d{4}|\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4})$/m)

Quantifiers specify the number of occurrences of the preceding element in the regex pattern. In this expression, quantifiers are used to specify the exact number of digits expected in the phone number: \d{3} for three digits and \d{4} for four digits. These quantifiers ensure that the area code and phone number parts have the correct length. Quantifiers help make regular expressions more flexible and concise by allowing repetition of patterns without needing to specify each character individually.

### Grouping Constructs
- (?: ... ): Grouping Constructs - Non-capturing group for the phone number pattern.
- (/^John\sDoe\s(?:\(\d{3}\)\s\d{3}-\d{4}|\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4})$/m)

 Grouping constructs, denoted by parentheses (...), are used to group elements of a regular expression together. In this regex, (?: ... ) is a non-capturing group, used to group alternative phone number patterns without capturing the match. This ensures that the entire phone number pattern is treated as a single unit for the OR operator. Grouping constructs are essential for organizing complex regex patterns, improving readability, and applying operators to multiple elements simultaneously.

### Bracket Expressions

 - Although not used in this specific regular expression, bracket expressions, also known as character classes, allow matching of any one of a set of characters. For example, [abc] would match either "a", "b", or "c". Bracket expressions provide a way to specify a range of characters or a set of characters that could match at a certain position in the text. They add versatility to regular expressions by allowing for pattern matching with a variety of character possibilities.

 - In this example, [abc] is a bracket expression that matches any one character that is either "a", "b", or "c". So, if this regular expression is applied to the input text, it will match any occurrence of "a", "b", or "c" individually.

### Character Classes
- John\sDoe: Character Classes - Literal characters "John" followed by whitespace \s and then "Doe".
- (/^John\sDoe\s(?:\(\d{3}\)\s\d{3}-\d{4}|\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4})$/m)
-
Character classes, denoted by \, represent sets of characters that can match at a particular position in the text. In this regex, \d represents any digit (equivalent to [0-9]), matching numerical digits in the input text. It's crucial for matching the numerical parts of the phone number. Similarly, \s represents any whitespace character (space, tab, newline), enabling matching of spaces between the name components "John" and "Doe". By using character classes, the regex becomes more versatile, allowing for precise matching of specific types of characters at designated positions within the text.

### The OR Operator
- |: OR Operator - Separates alternative patterns within the non-capturing group.
- (/^John\sDoe\s(?:\(\d{3}\)\s\d{3}-\d{4}|\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4})$/m)

The OR operator, represented by |, provides flexibility in matching alternative patterns within the regex. In this expression, the OR operator separates two alternative phone number patterns within the non-capturing group. One pattern matches phone numbers in the format (123) 456-7890, while the other matches numbers in the format 123-456-7890. The OR operator expands the regex's capability to handle different phone number formats, accommodating variations in the input text. By incorporating the OR operator, the regex becomes more adaptable, capable of capturing diverse phone number patterns encountered in real-world data.

### Flags
- (/^John\sDoe\s(?:\(\d{3}\)\s\d{3}-\d{4}|\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4})$/m)

/m is added after the closing delimiter to indicate the multiline flag. This flag modifies the behavior of anchors (^ and $), allowing them to match the start and end of each line within the input text, rather than just the start and end of the entire string. This is particularly useful when dealing with multiline text where each line represents a separate data entry.

With the multiline flag added, the regex pattern now ensures that "John Doe" followed by a valid phone number is matched at the beginning of each line within the input text, facilitating accurate extraction of desired information from multiline data sources.

### Character Escapes
- \(\d{3}\)\s\d{3}-\d{4}: Character Escapes, Quantifiers - Matches phone numbers in the format (123) 456-7890.
- (/^John\sDoe\s(?:\(\d{3}\)\s\d{3}-\d{4}|\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4})$/m)

Character escapes in regular expressions are used to match specific characters or sequences of characters that have special meanings in regex syntax. In the provided regular expression, the backslash \ is used for character escapes.

Here's how character escapes are used in the regex pattern:

\( and \) are used to escape the opening and closing parentheses, respectively. In regular expressions, parentheses are metacharacters with special meanings (used for grouping and capturing). By escaping them with a backslash, \( and \) match the literal opening and closing parentheses in the input text.
Similarly, \d is a character escape representing any digit (equivalent to the character class [0-9]). It matches numerical digits in the input text. In the regex pattern, \d{3} is used to match exactly three digits, ensuring accurate matching of the area code in the phone number.
\s is another character escape representing any whitespace character (space, tab, newline). It matches whitespace characters in the input text. In the regex pattern, \s is used to match the whitespace between the name components "John" and "Doe", ensuring flexibility in handling variations in whitespace.
